# Wolpertinger Build Distribution

iOS/Android build distribution service and web client for Wolpertinger
Live at: <https://builds.wolpertingergames.com>

**Main use case:**  
- Manage user's access/roles for projects and builds. New users have no projects assigned to them initially, they require an admin to authorize it for them.
- Keep track of each build's info and location as the Continuous Integration System pushes them.
- Can generate a build's Plist and a pre-signed link for direct download from Amazon S3. On Android it just generates the pre-signed link as no Plist is required.

## API Reference
### Authentication
Only users with the role of *superAdmin* have access to the back-end API. To generate a JWT you must post your email and password as a JSON to:
```
/auth/authenticate
```
After that, include your token as an Authorization header for every request using the format: 'Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN'
```
'Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN'
```
You can query your data by sending a GET request with the JWT attached to the following route:
```
/auth/me
```
